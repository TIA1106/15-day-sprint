# 🚀 15-Day Full Stack + AI Sprint

Welcome to my self-paced 15-day sprint where I’m leveling up in:
- DSA (LeetCode)
- Data Science (ML, EDA, Streamlit)
- Agentic AI (LangChain, LLMs)
- Full Stack Dev (React, Next.js, APIs)

---

## 🧠 Goal

> 🔥 Become job-ready by building projects, pushing daily code, and learning in public.
