# 🍷 Wine Classification App - Streamlit + Scikit-learn

This is a Streamlit web app that classifies wine samples into three categories using 3 machine learning models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Naive Bayes**

You can choose between:
- **Selecting a model and viewing its performance** (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix).
- **Giving custom feature inputs to predict wine quality.**

## 📂 Dataset Used
We use the built-in `load_wine()` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, which contains:

- 178 wine samples
- 13 features (like alcohol, magnesium, flavanoids, etc.)
- 3 target classes (wine cultivars)

🧠 Features
Trains and evaluates 6 classifiers:

Logistic Regression
KNN
Random Forest
SVM
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Displays accuracy scores for all models.
Offers a custom input form where you can enter feature values and predict wine class.
