# 📊 Data Science – Day 4

### ✅ Models Evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression  
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 🔍 Dataset:
- Breast Cancer Classification (sklearn)

### 📈 Results:
| Model               | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 97.4%    |
| KNN (k=3)           | 94.7%    |

### 🧠 Learnings:
- Logistic Regression works well for binary classification with linearly separable data
- KNN accuracy depends heavily on the choice of `k` and data scaling
- Model evaluation using `confusion_matrix` and `classification_report`
