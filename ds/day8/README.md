# 📊 Day 8 – Data Science Sprint Log

## ✅ Dataset
- **Heart Disease UCI Dataset**  
  Used to classify patients based on presence or absence of heart disease.

## ⚙️ Models Trained
| Model              | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 82%      |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 92%      |
| Random Forest       | 84%      |
| Support Vector Machine | 87%  |

✅ Trained and evaluated using `accuracy`, `confusion matrix`, and `classification report`.

## 🧠 Learnings
- **Model Comparisons:** Saw how KNN performed better here due to pattern sensitivity.
- **Confusion Matrix Mastery:** Understood precision/recall differences.
- **Streamlit UI Integration:**
  - Loaded model dynamically using dropdown.
  - Displayed live accuracy + confusion matrix.
  - Styled classification report as gradient DataFrame.
- Appreciated the transition from **Jupyter Notebook → Interactive App.**

---

## 🚀 Outcome
Deployed a fully working **Streamlit-based classifier app** for heart disease detection.  
✔️ Clean UI  
✔️ Model selector  
✔️ Metrics visualized  
✔️ No code reruns on update (efficient design)
