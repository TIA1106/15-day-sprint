# 📊 Day 9 – Data Science Sprint Log

## ✅ Dataset
- **Diabetes prediction Dataset**  
  Used to classify patients as likely to have diabetes or not.

## ⚙️ Models Trained
| Model              | 
|--------------------|
| Logistic Regression |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 
| Random Forest (best here)      | 
| SVM|

✅ Trained and evaluated using `accuracy`, `confusion matrix`, and `classification report`.

## 🧠 Learnings
- **Model Comparisons:** Saw how rabdom forest performed better here.
- **Confusion Matrix Mastery:** Understood precision/recall differences.
- **Streamlit UI Integration:**
  - Loaded best model to predict correctly.
  - predicted thorugh random forest whther person is likely to have diabetes.
- Appreciated the transition from **Jupyter Notebook → Interactive App.**
